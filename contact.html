    <!-- create a menu using unordered list. inside it 
		we have list and these will be the links inside the menu-. 
		at first had buller points and line undr it. so to change
		 this style ur ul in .css 
		
		to create help create a box around the list use the nav container 
		and place the ul inside the nav tags. We use the 
		nav tags for a menu cuz the browser actually identitfies 
		this section as a menu so its a good idea not to use a pair 
		of div tags which is what i was thinking to create a section.
		 cuz the div tag doesnt really identify what were 
		inserting inside of it. Helps the browser see what inside 
		ur code
